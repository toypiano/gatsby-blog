# Hello World

Hi there! My name is Nayoun Kim. I am an illustrator currently living in Toronto, Ontario Canada. This is my website showcasing my works and you can also find information about my shows and exhibitions. You can also check out my blog posts which I try to update whenever there is something I like to share with the world. I am really excited that you came here to check out my website! Hope you can find something interesting. Comments and emails are always welcome. :)
