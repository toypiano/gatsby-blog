# A little bit about myself

I was born in Seoul, South Korea in late 20th century when people were still buy music CDs from record stores(you can guess how old I am!). I moved to Toronto in 2008 and studied illustrations at Sheridan College where I met many great artists I became friends with. I had my private shows and collections around Toronto and Seoul at various galleries and galas. If you were around Queen St. West of Toronto and saw a big mural on the side of a three-story building in 2011, you already saw my work! It was one of my illustrations featured through the xxx gallery and it portraits the first Canadian female aviator, XXX who pioneered ....
Between 2012 and 2019 I moved back to Seoul where I had opportunities to collaborate with many artists and musicians. During this periods my works have been featured on TV shows, album covers, and even a music video! In the Fall of 2020, I returned to Toronto with my lovely family and I am really excited to begin my another journey in this beautiful city of diversity and culture.
